# Multiplicative-Persistence-Auto-Number-Tester
What it does is it takes your inputted value and finds the first number that has that amount of steps it takes to multiply to a one-digit number.

ANYONE can use this code.  Its python and many people have done the same thing so i don't care lol

Just extract the zip and run the .py file through a site like repl.it or through your downloaded Python 3 shell.  The backup.txt file was just a file I used in the coding process in case something in my previous version was messed up.
